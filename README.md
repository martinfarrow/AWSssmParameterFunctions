# AWSssmParameterFunctions
Some functions to facilitate shell operations on parameter store values

Functions are contained in ssm-function.sh, which must be sourced for use.

```sh
. ./ssm-functions
```

would suffice. Note you must have the aws CLI installed for these functions to work.

This is a quick and dirty release so that colleagues can start to use. This will be updated later.

Have a look at example.sh for examples of how to use.
